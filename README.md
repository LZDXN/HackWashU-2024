- Problem statement - 

Have you ever encountered a writers block? Have you ever had trouble depicting a specific scene in your head? Have you ever been unsure how to overcome this? Well we have created an webapp that helps you overcome this block and shows you a possiblity of different options to depict this. 





- Inspiration 

When we were trying to figure out how to come up with an idea, many of us had several different ideas. After discussing our passions, we, then realized three of us were trying to write a novel but were encountering issues of writers’ block. From here we knew that we wanted to do something that involved writing and how to overcome our individual writing blocks. So, we wanted to create a webapp that could do just that! 


- Solution (Project Description)



Front end: 


-	On the left side of the screen the files are stored in a database. The User can create, edit, or delete these files. 

-	On the middle of the page, there is a text box in which the user can view the text from a particular file that they have chosen. This text could be chapters or stories, the content of each file can be viewed in this text box and the user can modify it. 

-	On the right side of the page there an input box for key words which can be modified. Lastly, there is a button that says, “Generate Image”, the user can click this button after everything was put in and an image will be generated. 


Back end: 


-	The story and the keywords are sent to a LLM (OpenAI chatGBT3.5) to optimize the number of tokens, we need to optimize the number tokens because the image AI generator can only take a maximum of 75 tokens. Afterwards, we send the optimized string data to an image AI generator (Stability AI), and finally the image will be generated.
